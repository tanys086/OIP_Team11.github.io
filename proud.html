                            <h3>What We Take Pride In</h3>
                            <p>Throughout this project, our team delivered a variety of outputs, and we can identify both accomplishments we are proud of and areas that need improvement. Reflecting on our work gives us a clearer understanding of our successes and shortcomings.</p>
                            <p>One achievement we are particularly proud of is the quality of our weekly videos. By the second week, our content became more polished and easier to understand, effectively presenting our project using the double diamond model. We also enhanced the aesthetics of the week 2 video compared to the week 1 video, making it more engaging and visually appealing. This progression reflects our ability to learn from initial attempts and continuously improve our presentation skills.</p>
                            <p>We also take pride in our prototyping process. We showed initiative by sourcing the materials and tools needed to produce a clear and functional cardboard prototype. Following the double diamond model provided structure to our ideation and prototyping stages. Furthermore, our thoughtful task allocation enabled us to complete various deliverables smoothly, including the videos, poster, prototypes, and website.</p>
                            <p>What we are ultimately proud of is the progress we made in our project. We successfully completed the project within the given time frame, meeting all the requirements and deadlines. This demonstrates our dedication, hard work, and effective project management skills.</p>

                            <h3>What We Can Improve On</h3>
                            <p>Despite our successes, there are areas we are less proud of. Our first week's video lacked aesthetic appeal, significantly impacting viewer engagement. The visuals were bland, and the editing was unpolished, a deficiency we deeply regret. This highlights the crucial need for greater investment in pre- and post-production for future videos.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, early prototyping suffered from communication breakdowns. Poor task delegation and inconsistent updates led to duplicated effort, wasted time, and design flaws requiring frustrating revisions. This experience underscored the critical importance of proactive communication and meticulous planning for efficient teamwork. We've since implemented improved communication strategies to prevent similar issues.</p>
                            <p>In summary, we recognize that strengthening communication, planning our time more effectively, and conducting proper testing would have elevated our project further.</p>
